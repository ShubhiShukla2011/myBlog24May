      <p>n support of the Government’s concentrated effort to control violations of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Prohibition Act (COPTA), an Anti Tobacco Drive was conducted in the local community by the members of the ‘Somerville School Anti Tobacco Committee’ on 31st July 2018.

       The COPTA Act bars smoking at public places, promotion of Tobacco products, sale to minors and near educational institutions and mandatory pictorial warning on tobacco packets. To check violations of the COPTA prohibition of sale of tobacco products to minors and within 100 metres of the school, the Anti-Tobacco Committee members consisting of two teachers and two students, went around shops located around the school boundary wall and checked them to see if they were selling any tobacco products. Four such shops were identified and the shopkeepers were informed of the law and warned of penal action if sale of tobacco products continued near the school.

       The local police authorities were also informed through a letter with photographs of the findings of the Anti-Tobacco team of the school so that further action could be taken as per the provisions of COPTA.Students of Class VI were taken to the Nehru Planetarium on 25.7.18 on an educational trip. 210 students with five teachers were shown the Full Sky Theatre Show. The students were also taken around the library and museum in Teen Murti Bhawan, where they learned about the life of our first Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru.

       It was a very informative trip and was thoroughly enjoyed by the students.On 19th May 2018, students and teachersfrom 11 schools, one from each district, were present in the Conference Hall, Delhi High Court to give a feedback about the awareness sessions held by DLSA in their schools. Somerville School, Vasundhara Enclave was the only representative school from East District, Delhi.

       Mahima Mehra of Class XII and Harleen Kaur of Class X along with their teacher representative, Mrs. Chitrali Singh Bhardwaj, attended this interactive feedback session.

       Dr Aditi Choudhary, Senior High Court Judge, welcomed everyone and the programme started with a round of introductions. The meeting was very interactive where each student and teacher was given the opportunity to share their observations about the strengths and weaknesses of the programme.The participants from all parts of Delhi spoke about several issues like sexual harassment and rapes.

       An issue that was brought up by several students was about imposing restrictions on the media when it comes to reporting sensitive topics such as sexual offences. Another matter that was discussed was how Bollywood movies often conveyed the wrong message to the audience, and hence promoted offences such as stalking and sexual harassment. In response to this, the Honourable Chief Justice Mittal said that the younger generation can use the social media as a positive platform to bring about change in the society. She encouraged them to start a movement; to gather enough number of students and make use of the internet.

       Each student was further given the responsibility of carrying this initiative by putting up posters, distributing flyers, organising plays and conducting assemblies in their respective schools.

       After this session the students also got a chance to visit the courtroom of the Honourable Chief Justice, the Judges’ Lounge, the Chief Justice’s Chamber and the Mediation Room.

       The openness and patience of the secretaries of the DSLA, Judges of HC as well the Chief Justice herself, made this an extremely motivating and enriching experience.
